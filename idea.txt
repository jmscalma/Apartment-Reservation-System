I want to develop an apartment reservation system.
Basically, I want to have 2 main users:
 - user 
 - owner

Functionalities:
    User 
       - create an account
       - apartment search Allow users to search for apartments based on location, price range, amenities, number of rooms, etc.
       - get list of apartments
          - filter by location, rate (how much), and feedback or rate(like 1-5 stars)
       - select and view specific apartment Provide detailed information about each apartment, including pictures, address, rent price, utilities, and nearby facilities.
       - make a reservation if still available 
       - chat Enable users to ask questions or contact apartment owners through a built-in chat system.
       - leave a review and rating
       - wishlist
       - notification
       - profile
       - map? Use Google Maps API to display apartment locations and nearby landmarks (universities, workplaces, public transport, etc.).
       

    Owner 
       - create an account
       - My apartments feature
            - add apartment (name, location, price, description, rooms available)
       - receive inquiries from the owner
